# opencv_clustering

This project implement the DBSCAN algorithm.
An improved version of OpenCV's KMeans algorithm, which can accept an custom norm function, is also implemented.
Several norm functions, which are supported by the KMeans algorithm, are also implemented.
Several test functions are also implement present.
The Cuda implementation of both the KMeans, DBSCAN and the metric functions is currently under development.
